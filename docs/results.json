In this case, the complexity arises from the various conditions and loops within the `router.post('/check/:deviceId', async (req, res) => {` function, which can quickly increase as more conditions are added.\n\nTo reduce the cyclomatic complexity, we can refactor the code by extracting the alert checking logic into a separate function. This will simplify the main route handler and keep the cyclomatic complexity within acceptable limits.\n\nHere's a single line change that encapsulates the alert triggering logic into a separate function:\n\n```suggestion\nrouter.post('/check/:deviceId', async (req, res) => { const { deviceId } = req.params; const { currentValue } = req.body; await checkAlerts(deviceId, currentValue); res.status(200).send('Check complete'); });\n```\n\nIn this suggestion, `checkAlerts` would be a new function that you would define elsewhere in your code, handling the logic for checking alerts, thus reducing the complexity of the route handler itself.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

If an attacker is able to manipulate the input to return a large number of alerts, it could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition by consuming excessive server resources during the processing of that array.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we can implement a safeguard that limits the number of alerts processed at one time, ensuring that the application does not become overwhelmed by large datasets.
