A cyclomatic complexity of 9 exceeds the recommended limit of 8, which suggests that the function may benefit from being simplified or refactored.\n\nTo reduce the complexity, one effective approach is to extract the logic for checking alerts into a separate function. This will help to streamline the main route handler and reduce its complexity.\n\nHere is a single line change suggestion that encapsulates the alert checking logic into a separate function:\n\n```suggestion\nrouter.post('/check/:deviceId', async (req, res) => await checkAlerts(req, res));\n```\n\nYou would then define the `checkAlerts` function elsewhere in your code, which would handle the alert checking logic. This separation of concerns will help reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the route handler.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

If an attacker can manipulate the number of alerts returned by the `Alert.find()` query (for instance, by flooding the system with alerts), it could lead to excessive resource consumption and degrade the performance of the application.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, you can limit the number of alerts processed in the loop. A common approach is to set a maximum threshold for the number of alerts that can be processed. This can prevent an attacker from overwhelming the system with a large number of alerts.\n\nHere\u2019s a single line change that can be made to limit the number of alerts processed:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n```\n\nIn this suggestion, the loop will only process up to 100 alerts, regardless of how many alerts are actually found, thus helping to mitigate the potential DoS risk.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

Specifically, if the destructured variables are only used once and are not part of a more complex operation, the linter suggests that they can be accessed directly from `req.body` without the need for a separate block.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can directly access the properties of `req.body` when creating the new `Alert` instance, rather than destructuring them first. Here's the suggested change:\n\n```suggestion\n    const alert = new Alert({ deviceId: req.body.deviceId, condition: req.body.condition, threshold: req.body.threshold, message: req.body.message, owner: req.user.userId });\n```\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
