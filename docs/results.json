Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code, and a higher complexity can indicate that the function is doing too much, making it harder to understand and maintain.\n\nTo reduce the complexity, we can extract the logic that checks the alerts and triggers any actions into a separate function. This way, the main route handler remains simpler and more focused.\n\nHere's a single line change that encapsulates the alert-checking logic into its own function:\n\n```suggestion\nconst handleAlerts = async (alerts, currentValue) => { /* logic here */ }; // Define this function elsewhere\n```\n\nThis change suggests that you define a new function `handleAlerts` to manage the alert logic, keeping the route handler cleaner and reducing its cyclomatic complexity. The actual implementation of the `handleAlerts` function would need to be added separately, but this line indicates where to start refactoring.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

In this case, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the application is looping over a user-controlled object (`alerts`), which could be manipulated by an attacker to include a large number of entries. This could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU or memory usage) as the loop processes each alert, potentially causing the server to become unresponsive.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, we can add a safeguard to limit the number of alerts processed in the loop. Here\u2019s a code suggestion to implement this:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n```\n\nThis change limits the loop to a maximum of 100 alerts, reducing the risk of a denial of service attack by preventing the server from being overwhelmed by a large number of alerts.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
