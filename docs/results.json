Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code, and a higher number indicates that the function may be doing too much or is too complex, making it harder to maintain and test.\n\nTo address this, we can simplify the logic within the function by extracting parts of it into smaller, more manageable functions. However, since you requested a single line change, we can reduce the complexity by returning early if there are no alerts found, which will help to decrease the overall complexity.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n```suggestion\nif (alerts.length === 0) return res.status(204).send('No alerts found');\n``` \n\nThis line checks if there are no alerts and sends a 204 No Content response, allowing the function to exit early and reducing the complexity by avoiding nested logic.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

In this case, the `alerts` array is fetched from the database based on a user-provided `deviceId`, which could allow an attacker to create a large number of alerts for a single device. If the number of alerts becomes excessively large, it could lead to performance degradation or exhaustion of resources when the application processes them in a loop.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, you can limit the number of alerts processed in the loop, ensuring that the application does not become overwhelmed by user-controlled input. A common approach is to set a maximum limit for the number of items processed.\n\nHere's a single line change that sets a maximum limit on the number of alerts processed:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n``` \n\nThis suggestion limits the loop to a maximum of 100 alerts, which helps prevent a potential denial of service attack while still allowing the application to function normally. Adjust the limit based on your application's requirements and performance considerations.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
