Cyclomatic complexity is a metric used to measure the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. A higher complexity indicates that the method may be doing too much, making it harder to read, test, and maintain.\n\nTo reduce the complexity, one approach is to refactor the logic inside the method into smaller, more manageable functions. However, since you requested a single line change, we can introduce early returns to simplify the flow of the code and reduce complexity.\n\nHere\u2019s a code suggestion that introduces an early return if no alerts are found, which can help lower the cyclomatic complexity:\n\n```suggestion\nif (alerts.length === 0) return res.status(204).send('No alerts found');\n``` \n\nThis line can be added right after fetching the alerts, thereby reducing the complexity by avoiding unnecessary nested logic.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

If an attacker can control the number of alerts returned (for example, by sending a large number of alerts), it could lead to a denial of service (DoS) situation by overwhelming the server with processing.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we can limit the number of alerts processed by introducing a maximum threshold on the number of alerts that can be handled in a single request. This will help prevent excessive resource consumption and potential DoS attacks.\n\nHere's a code suggestion that introduces a limit on the number of alerts processed:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n``` \n\nIn this suggestion, we limit the loop to a maximum of 100 alerts, which can be adjusted based on the application's requirements.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release.](https://app.codacy.com/gh/devotiontoc/code_reviewer_comparison/pull-requests/6)\n\nThe issue identified by the Semgrep linter is that the action `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` is referenced using a version tag (`v2`) instead of a specific commit SHA. Using a version tag can lead to potential security vulnerabilities because the action could change if the maintainers update it, which may introduce breaking changes or security issues. Pinning to a full-length commit SHA ensures that the exact version of the action being used is fixed and immutable, providing better security and stability.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should replace the version tag with the full-length commit SHA of the specific version you want to use. You can find the commit SHA by checking the GitHub repository for `tibdex/github-app-token` and looking for the commit corresponding to version `v2`.\n\nHere\u2019s the code suggestion with the change:\n\n```suggestion\n        uses: tibdex/github-app-token@<full-length-commit-SHA>\n``` \n\nMake sure to replace `<full-length-commit-SHA>` with the actual SHA you find in the repository.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
