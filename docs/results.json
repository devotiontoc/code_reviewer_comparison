In this case, the `router.post('/check/:deviceId', async (req, res) => {` function has a complexity of 9, which exceeds the limit of 8. This indicates that the function is doing too much, making it harder to understand and maintain.\n\nTo reduce the cyclomatic complexity, one effective approach could be to extract the logic that checks the alerts into a separate function. This way, the main function remains simpler and adheres to the complexity limit.\n\nHere's a single line change that encapsulates the alert checking logic into a separate function:\n\n```suggestion\nconst triggerAlerts = async (deviceId, currentValue) => { /* alert checking logic here */ }; \n```\n\nThis change suggests creating a new function `triggerAlerts` that would handle the alert checking logic, thus simplifying the main route handler.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

If an attacker can manipulate the request in such a way that it causes the application to process a very large number of alerts, it could lead to performance degradation or even crash the server. This is a common concern when dealing with user input that can control the size of data being processed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, you can limit the number of alerts processed by adding a check to restrict the number of alerts that can be retrieved or processed. This can help prevent excessive resource consumption.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple code suggestion that limits the number of alerts processed:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n```\n\nThis change ensures that even if there are more than 100 alerts, only the first 100 will be processed, thus reducing the risk of a DoS attack.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
