Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code, and high complexity can make code harder to understand and maintain.\n\nTo reduce the complexity, we can refactor the logic inside the route handler into a separate function. This will help keep the main route handler concise and improve readability.\n\nHere is a single line change suggestion to achieve this:\n\n```suggestion\nrouter.post('/check/:deviceId', handleDeviceCheck);\n``` \n\nYou would then define `handleDeviceCheck` as a separate function to encapsulate the logic currently inside the route handler.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

This can occur if an attacker sends a large number of alerts for a specific device, causing the application to loop through a large array of user-controlled data. This can lead to performance degradation or denial of service, as the server may become overwhelmed by the processing of these alerts.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we can limit the number of alerts processed in the loop. A common approach is to impose a maximum threshold on the number of alerts that can be handled at once.
