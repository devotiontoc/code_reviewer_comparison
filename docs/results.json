Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code, and a high complexity can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n\nTo reduce the complexity, we can refactor the code by moving the logic that checks the alerts into a separate function. This will help to simplify the original method and keep it more manageable.\n\nHere is a single line change suggestion that encapsulates the alert-checking logic into a separate function:\n\n```suggestion\nconst checkAlerts = async (alerts, currentValue) => { /* alert-checking logic */ }; // Move the alert-checking logic here\n``` \n\nThis suggestion implies creating the `checkAlerts` function and calling it from within the original route handler, which will help in reducing the cyclomatic complexity of the route handler itself.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"

If an attacker can control the input to the `deviceId`, they might exploit this to create a situation where the `alerts` array contains a large number of items, leading to a denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive resources during the loop execution.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, you can limit the number of alerts processed in the loop. One common approach is to impose a maximum limit on the number of alerts that can be processed. This can be done by slicing the array to only include a predefined maximum number of elements.\n\nHere's a code suggestion to implement this fix:\n\n```suggestion\n    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(alerts.length, 100); i++) {\n``` \n\nThis change ensures that no more than 100 alerts are processed, which helps to prevent potential denial of service attacks while still allowing the functionality of the application.\n\n---\n\n *This comment was generated by an experimental AI tool.*"
